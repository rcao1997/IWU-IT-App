# IWU-IT-App

This is a Github repository for IWU IT App. In this repository, the documents here are not all the code documents in this app, but only those changed based on "Tab-start project" in ionic.

This app is developed by Rui Cao, Ziyan Liu and Blake Tempel for the Information Technology Department in Illinois Wesleyan University. 

## How to use this app? 

This app has 4 tabs in the bottom line: Home, Live Chat, Submit a ticket and Search. 

In the home page, we have 5 categories (will change) for users to select: network, email, change password, cable TV and software. When the users click on those categories, the app will lead the users to another page that describes the detailed information in this category. 

Inside the page for each category, there is related information in FAQ format, and the questions are listed by frequency. The questions we have for now is a first draft, and will be improved for better explanation. 

In the Live Chat page, the users can have a live chat with the student workers in ITS Help Desk and have their issues being solved. 

The "submit a ticket" page is linked to the SpringShare database, and the users can submit a ticket to request a IT help without opening a website that doesn't fit the phone screen. 

In the search page, the users can type their questions and find the answers quickly. The questions will be found based on any ketwords in the questions users search.
