	      How do I set up my gaming system to the IWU network?
	    </ion-card-title>
	    <p>
	      Answer: However, at the current moment, consoles are not able to do any kind of authentication with usernames and passwords on our wireless networks. Having a wired internet connection is a necessity for gaming on our campus network. Each room in every residence hall has an ethernet port, one for each student in the room. This means you may need an additional piece of hardware to share the ports between your roommate and other computer equipment, depending on the amount of devices.
