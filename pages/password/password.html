<h1><em><strong>Changing Your Password</strong></em></h1>

<h2>Have you forgotten your password?</h2>
<strong>If you have forgotten your password, <a href = "http://answers.iwu.edu/3900/ask"><em>ITS Help Desk</em></a> can help you reset your password.</strong> Students, faculty and staff can do this in person at the Help Desk. You will be asked for either IWU ID or drivers license. 

<h2>Password</h2>
Your password is set by you as part of process for logging into Illinois Wesleyan services for the first time. If you have never logged into the campus portal (MyIWU), you will use a temporary password to begin the process.

(Incoming Students will receive a letter by mail with a temporary password and a step by step guide on how to set your campus password.)

(Faculty & Staff will be given initial password by human resources.) 

To set your campus password, <a href="https://passchange.iwu.edu/"><em>go to passchange.iwu.edu</em></a> and enter your NetID. You will use a temporary password the first time you login. 

Note: Temporary passwords can only be used at passchange.iwu.edu, they will not work to authenticate to any IWU service.

<h2>Before Changing your Password</h2>
It's important to make sure that your password is strong. If someone else can guess it, or if you ever share it with anyone, that person can log in as you and wreak havoc in your name. Here are some tips for choosing a good password that nobody will be likely to guess:

Use at least nine characters. A shorter password can be guessed in almost no time at all. All passwords at Illinois Wesleyan must be at least nine characters, but longer is better.
Use different types of characters. A password that consists only of lowercase letters is easiest to enter, but it's also one of the first things a password cracker might try. All passwords at Illinois Wesleyan must include at least one digit. Your password should also contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. Symbols are a great idea, too.
Common passwords are inherently weak, so we also check them against a public list of the 10,000 most commonly used passwords and reject any that match.
The server rejects passwords for other reasons, such as including your NetID, or a part of your name, in your password. It may also reject passwords for including common words. We can't validate every possible reason your password may be rejected on this page, but we'll let you know if your new password is rejected and you can choose something more secure.
<h2>Changing your Password</h2>
In order to change your Password, you will need to go to the Password Management page. Your new password will need to be at least 9 characters long and must contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters and at least one number.
